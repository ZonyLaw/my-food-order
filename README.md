# My Food Order

The key structure of the restaurant front-end website is built using REACT. It is rolled out in Netlify so can be explored dynamically at https://thriving-figolla-76eaaf.netlify.app/.

This website uses a mock up of the back-end with json files listing the restaurants and menu. 

I am updating this every week, so do come back and check out the progress.

I intend to add some test in Jest and also turn this into typescript.
