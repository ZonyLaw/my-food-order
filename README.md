# My Food Order

This is a restaurant website developed in REACT and rolled out in Netlify.
The core features allows people to book order from different restaurants which is recorded in the cart and amendments can be made in the checkout page. Please have a explore of the live website at https://thriving-figolla-76eaaf.netlify.app/

The app explores techniques using the following:
- context hooks,
- routes,
- navigation, and
- component structures with clear naming of components and scss.
- Use JSON files to store the list of restaurants and menu items as a mock up of the back-end.

Here is the home page or landing page:

## Still Under Development

1) In github, I have created a another branch where I set up some unit tests. This uses the React Testing Libraries (RTL) with Jest. 

2) Another task I intend to do is turn this into typescript.

3) Improve the formating and refactoring
